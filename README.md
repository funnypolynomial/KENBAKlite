See [Kenbakuino](https://github.com/funnypolynomial/Kenbakuino)

This version of my Kenbakuino project dispenses with the complication of push-buttons and LEDs and just has a Touch LCD shield on an Arduino Uno (plus an RTC).  The KENBAK-1 emulation is identical, just re-skinned:
* the arrangement of the buttons and LEDs is changed to fit the 320x240 display
* chords are implemented by pressing and holding the first button until it locks down, then pressing the second button
* there is reasonable extensive but terse help available under the hamburger menu top left
* the hamburger menu also allows configuration of the start-up program, the time etc
