KENBAKlite
This is a Kenbakuino 
* MINUS: 12 LEDs, 15 switches and associated wiring but
* PLUS: a touch-screen LCD.
It's an experiment in greatly simplifying the hardware required to approximate the retro-computer "look and feel."

A touch-capable 320x240 TFT LCD shield is added to a Uno and the sketch modified so the LEDs and buttons are
drawn as part of a facsimile of the KENBAK front panel.
The LED states are shown on the screen. 
Interaction with the buttons/switches is by touching them on the screen.

The Kenbakuino used key-chords (pressing two buttons) to perform extended actions like loading a built-in program.
The Lite version achieves the same effect by letting a button be locked down by pressing and holding it. 
Pressing another button creates the chord and releases the lock (except for single stepping, pressing STRT with STOP locked)

The functionality of startup chords (to set a program to auto-run etc) is accessed via menus under a hamburger button at the 
top-left of the screen.

The menu system also provides access to pages of (terse) information about chords, opcodes etc.
